The age Finder App i had created in 6th grade[2016] so i had to get the code from my old email and add it to vs code. It was very buggy and inefficent,
as it had nearly 8000 lines of unmanageable code but in turn learned the usefulness of good programming practise. It was still a very difficult feet and hence
improved my basics in programming vastly


Rest of the folders are related to Data structures and algorithms which i had done during 1st and 2nd sem of college.
